Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the
first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next
greater element as -1.

Examples:
a) For any array, rightmost element always has next greater element as -1.
b) For an array which is sorted in decreasing order, all elements have next greater element as -1.
c) For the input array [4, 5, 2, 25], the next greater elements for each element are as follows.

if involve locality of 1-dimensional array, consider stack
